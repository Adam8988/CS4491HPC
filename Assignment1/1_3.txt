Try to write pseudo-code for the tree-structured global sum illustrated in
Figure 1.1. Assume the number of cores is a power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, . . . ).


the trivial act of giving out data to each core is assumed completed
Activecores=number of cores allocated by OS/programmer
i=0;

while (ActiveCores>1)
	if my_corenumber % 2^(i+1) equals 0
		enter wait for message (daemon) mode
	else 
		send message to my_corenumber-2^(i)
		Activecores--
	i++
return number from core 0
