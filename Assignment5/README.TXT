The impact of the parallelization of the merge function on the efficiency Was not seen at the lower data sets. Advantages were seen in the parallel version when larger data sets were seen. On the smaller data set the serial version was quicker. The first time I tried to write the parallel merge, i actually made the entire merge sort much much slower because of multiple array copies and read/writes.
